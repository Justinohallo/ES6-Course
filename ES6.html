<ul>
    <li>Let variables are meant to be updated. Const variables are not meant to be updated. </li>
    <li>The properties of a const object can be changed. </li>
    <li> In an object, the object keys cannot be changed, but you can update the data. </li>
    <li> The object name represents something. The age of that something can change. You can update the age from 28 to 29. </li>
</ul>

<h3> Const and Let in the Real World </h3>

<ul>
    <li> Immediately invoked function expresion. Creates a scope and nothing will leak into the global scope. 
    </li>
    <li> Using var in an if statement creates a data leak.  </li>
</ul>

<h3> Temporal Dead Zone</h3>
<p>  If you try to console.log a variable before it is declared, it is undefined. The variable has been created but the data is undefined. 
    If you use let or const, you cannot access a variable before it has been created.
